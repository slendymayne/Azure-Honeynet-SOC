##Configuring Honeypot VMs in Azure
<b>To create the open vulnerable environment, the first step is to deploy 2 virtual machines and configure the NSGs to allow inbound connections from any source to any port:</b>
- Log into your Azure account and select Virtual Machines.
- Click on (+) to create a new virtual machine (One running Linux and another running Windows)
- Ensure both VMs are on the same Resource Group, Region, and VNet(i.e 10.1.0.0/16)
- After creating the Windows VM, RDP into the machine and turn off its firewall via **wf.msc**
-
